        <p> Wild hunt heathcliff is one if not the coolest Heathcliff Identities in Limbus company. He is also Heathcliff's bad end Id that's a alternate version of erkling heathcliff. This Id's whole story changes after the events of his story or also known in game as canto, the story beforehand involves him reminiscing on past events of his "umbrella" or Catherine who was the only reason he had stayed at the manor also known as wuthering heights. He then returns to the manor having gained the power to control the dead, specifically the former residents of the manor and he brings ruin to wuthering heights. After the canto due to how Catherine got all versions of her deleted he doesn't think about Catherine anymore but does think to himself that something felt missing but he couldn't remember. Again he brings ruin to Wuthering Heights like the former version. Overall, his outfit and design is amazing and the main reason why he's my favorite heathcliff id along with his coolness factor due to what I previously stated. </p>
