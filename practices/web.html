        <p> Wild hunt heathcliff is one if not the coolest Heathcliff Identities in Limbus company. He is also Heathcliff's bad end Id that's a alternate version of erkling heathcliff. This Id's whole story changes after the events of his story or also known in game as canto, the story beforehand involves him reminiscing on past events of his "umbrella" or Catherine who was the only reason he had stayed at the manor also known as wuthering heights. He then returns to the manor having gained the power to control the dead, specifically the former residents of the manor and he brings ruin to wuthering heights. After the canto due to how Catherine got all versions of her deleted he doesn't think about Catherine anymore but does think to himself that something felt missing but he couldn't remember. Again he brings ruin to Wuthering Heights like the former version. Overall, his outfit and design is amazing and the main reason why he's my favorite heathcliff id along with his coolness factor due to what I previously stated. </p>

        <h2>Heishou Pack-You Branch Adept Heathcliff</h2>
        <img src="https://limbuscompany.wiki.gg/images/thumb/Heishou_Pack_-_You_Branch_Adept_Heathcliff_Full_Uptied.png/498px-Heishou_Pack_-_You_Branch_Adept_Heathcliff_Full_Uptied.png?603bfe" alt="Heishou Pack-You Heathcliff art"/>
        <p>Heishou Pack heathcliff for short, is another really cool Heathcliff identity in  Limbus Company. He comes from the group of the Heishou Pack which are a group based on the animals in the Chinese Zodiac Signs with this Id being based off Roosters. Another important thing to discuss about Heishou Packs are that they are still people relatively human but are given boluses that give them mutations corresponding to the branch they would be apart of, in this case the You branch is given the ability to sprout the wings of a Rooster. This Id inflicts burn, a status that deals damage depedning on it's potency every turn and reduces count when that happens, and also inflicts rupture which deals damage based on potency and reduces count on hit. A reason I like him is mostly due to the prominence of red in this Id in both art and skills, as red is my favorite color after all.</p>
