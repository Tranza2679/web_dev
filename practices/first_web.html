        <h2>What is Library of Ruina?</h2>
        <p>Library of Ruina is a card deckbuilder indie game. The main gameplay format involves either fighting guests by inviting them to the Library using books you obtain from guests before, or fighing Abnormalities which are monsters that can only be fought to level up floors of the library when you obtain certain books. Once you defeat a guest you obtain their book in which you have the option to burn the book to get combat pages(or cards that you use during fights) and possibly their key pages(which when equipped to one of your librarians give them access to their passives and resistances along with any unique combat pages they have). It should also be noted what floors are in this game, in the Library there are multiple floors with different Patron Libarians which are the first characters you are able to use when you first unlock the floor and you need to gain more librarians by leveling up said floor. The floors are the Floor of general works, History,Technological Sciences,Literature, Art, Natural Sciences, Language, Social Sciences, Philosophy and Religion. The Patron Libarians for these floors are respicatively  Roland, Malkuth, Yesod, Hod, Netzach, Tiphereth, Gebura, Chesed, Binah and Hokma which are names based off the Tree of Life except for Roland for reasons I shall not state for now. Now for more gameplay aspects I should explain is Light which is the resource that you make your libarians use to use combat pages, of course some require 0 and some 5 and since light is so important you should run at least 1 combat page that restores light, you can also getr light by emotion levels. Before I explain emotion levels I'm going to explain what aare dices, so dices are what are used when you use a combat pages and there are three types of dices which are combat dices which have subcatagories like blunt, slash or pierce combat dices which have no speical effects besides either doing more damage or stagger damage(Enemies and allies alike have a stagger bar) to enemies or less based on their resistances, block dices which will lessen damage if they lose a clash(when two dices go against each other) or deal stagger damage based on the difference between the two rolls, evade dices which when they roll higher will ignore the attacking dice and recover stagger based on evade roll and be reused for the next attack hwoever if it rolls less the user will take damage and the evade dice reuse will not work if it clashes with a block dice, and lastly there are counter dices which only activate upon a one sided clash where the user of the counter dice will use the dice against the one sided attack and reuse it until the one sided attack is over or if it loses a clash(something to note is that these dices will not be reused again on another one sided attack unless it kills the enemy it was beforehand). There's also emotion levels which are gained when certain emotion point threshold, emotion points are gained whenever a character wins or loses a clash or when they roll the maximum or minimum values of a dice, there are two types of emotion points which are positive and negative coins which are gained depending if the action that made them get the emotion point was good or bad for them. When a emotion level is reached the respective character will get a buff and for the libarians if all of them reach a certain emotion level then abnormality pages(basically a buff that are based on the Abnormalities you have currently fought on the floor) can be given to one libarian, all of them or all characters and there are two types of these pages which are Awakening pages(buffs with no drawbacks) and Breakdown pages(stronger buff at the cost of a drawback). Later on in the game you get access to E.G.O pages which are strong attacks based off Abnormalities gained through these emotion levels</p>

        <h2>Red Mist Key Page</h2>
        <img src="https://libraryofruina.wiki.gg/images/TheRedMistIcon.png?3db556" alt="Red Mist's Reception Logo"/>
        <p>The Red Mist key page is obtainable by completing the reception of the Red Mist and can only be equipped by Gebura in the floor of Language. The reasons for this is that the Red Mist is what Gebura used to be in the past. The passives of this key page are Legendary, Retaliate, The Strongest and Speed III. The first passive, Legendary, makes it so only Gebura can equip the page and that a unique E.G.O becomes avaliable at emotion level 4 or above which is gained through the use of a special combat page of Manifest E.G.O. The second passive, Retaliate, makes it so Gebura always has a counter dice avaliable by giving her a strong counter dice at all times. The third passive, The Strongest, makes it so at every turn the dice with the lowest speed value will become a infinite speed dice or the maximum value. The fourth passive isn't anything note worthy because all it does is just give her a extra speed dice to use combat pages on at all times. Now the strength of this key page comes from her unique pages which are Great Split: Vertical, Great Split: Horizontal, Focus Spirit, Level Slash, Upstanding Slash, Spear and Onrush. Greater Split: Vertical and Horizontal I'll discuss at the same time, they are unique combat pages worth 5 and 6 light specifically, Greater Split: Vertical is a strong single dice that rolls 20-39 and has the unique effect on hit of destroying a combat page on another speed dice the person that got hit by it, Greater Split: Horizontal on the other hand rolls even higher as it rolls 28-42 along with being a Mass Attack page(A page that attacks all targets that rolled less than the value the mass attack rolled) but however can only be usuable when the Red Mist E.G.O is activated. To quickly discuss the unique E.G.O is that when activated will increase the roll of all dices by 2 but takes stagger damage when Gebura does less than 40 damage that turn and is lost when Gebura is staggered. Focus Spirit is a at first lackluster page having a 8-12 block dice then using a 5-7 blunt dice and costing 2 light to use this page, but this page makes Gebura gain 3 strength(boosts the rolls of all dice by how mujch strength is on user when gained for that turn) when the blunt dice hits. The next three combat pages have similar mechanics of rolling pretty high and only one specific type of combat dice(Level slash does slash damage, Spear does pierce damage and Upstanding Slash does Blunt damage) and they cost 2 light which may seem expensive at first however they all have the mechanic of lowering all copies of their respicative pages after dealing 8+ damage however Spear and Upstanding Slash of drawing one page while Level Slash restores one light as well when the 8+ damage threshold is met. Onrush is an interesting page as it only has a single strong slash dice rolling 14-26 for 3 light, however the dice will be reused on a random enemy if the enemy it had attacked beforehand had been staggered or killed. The Red Mist's page strength shows with how high her single target damage is along with her potential AOE damage, and how quick she's able to ramp up due to how her main pages who will use have special effects once dealing enough damage. Passives you may want to add to her page are specifically ones that boost power like Myo's Prowess which reads When using a Combat Page, all dice on the page gain Power against targets with slower Speed (+1 Power per 2 points of difference, up to 5) and or Grace of the Prescript which boosts the power of a random damage by 2.</p>

        <h2>Nikolai's Page</h2>
        <img src="https://libraryofruina.wiki.gg/images/RCorpIcon.png?bf1234" alt="R Corp's Reception Logo"/> 
        <p>Nikolai's Page is obtainable through both receptions of R Corp, though after the second reception of R corp there are more combat pages avaliable. Nikolai's page is one of the best support pages to have. The page becomes more better and gets most of it's power through the status called Charge. Charge's whole thing is on some specific combat pages it either gives charge or uses a specific amount of charge. However, unlike most other charge key pages the R Corp pages are able to hold 20 charge at once rather than the normal 10. Nikolai;s passives include Speed III, Triple-R suit, The Commander and Finishing Touch. Now the first 2 passives I won't go into much detail because of how we already know what Speed III does and Triple-R suit only allows the character with the key page equipped to hold 20 charge at once. The commander is where the page's suport capabilities are shown as what it does is when the libarian has 11+ charge they give 1 strength and endurance(increases defensive dice's power by the stack on self) to all allies. Finishing Touch inflicts a special status called 'Mark" on the first enemy hit on the scene that lasts for this scene and next, but can only be on one target at a time and what it does is make the enemy take 50% more damage and stagger damage for when the status is on them when attacked. She only has one unique combat page which is Disposal which is only usuable at 20 charge and is a powerful 2 dice attack rolling 15-30 on first dice which also destroys all of the oppenents next dices on clash win but on clash lose doesn't use the second dice and then 10-20 on the second dice that on hit if the target has 'Mark' then increases the damage and stagger damage by the natural roll which both deals twice as much damage on enemies with half health along with lowering cost by 1 and adds a copy of it to the character's deck because of how normally when it is used it is also exhausted(the page is unable to be used until the next act). Some advice for using this key page is either making a deck that captializes on Nikolai's suppport capibilities using passives that allow you to draw a lot more cards than normal along with giving the character buffs when they use charge. However, if you want more offensive capibilities for the page it is advised using the page disposal and more R corp pages.</p>

        <div id="purpletear">
        <h2>The Purple Tear's Page</h2>
        <img src="https://libraryofruina.wiki.gg/images/ThePurpleTearIcon.png?7ea68a" alt="Purple Tear's Reception Logo"/>
        <p>The Purple Tear's page is obtainable through the reception of the Purple Tear. The Purple tear is arguably one of the greatest key pages you can ever obtain. The passives for this page are Speed III, Manipulator of Odds and Changing Stances. You already know Speed III so that will not be discussed, but Manipulator of Odds works by whenever a dice rolls a minimium value it will reroll that dice changing its value but while it is broken already it can only activate once per a dice. Changing Stance is one of the most broken passives ever as it makes it  so at the start of the reception the character with the page equipped takes either a slash, blunt, pierce or defensive stance which increases the power of all the dices of the corresponding stance by 2 as well as giving a unique effect(slash stance makes all attacks deal 50% extra HP damage, blunt makes all attacks deal 50% extra stagger damage, pierce makes all pages inflict double the status effects and defensive stance makes it so the character with the page equipped is immune to status effects), do note that you are able to change stances at the cost of some light and that every stance has their own deck you need to make. Overall the Purple tear can fit into a multitude of team comps and different floors so it is necessarily up to you to decide what role or build you want the Purple Tear to be. </p>

        <h2>Distorted Yan's Page</h2>
        <img src="https://libraryofruina.wiki.gg/images/YanIcon.png?c50c1b" alt="Distorted Yan's Reception logo"/>
        <p>Distroted Yan's Page is obtained through the reception of Distorted Yan. This key page is another great support page like Nikolai but with some differences. The passives for this page are Speed III, 얀샋ㄷ요무, and The Messenger.The passive of 얀샋ㄷ요무 makes it so when the character with Yan's page equipped as more Breakdown abnormality pages rather than Awakening pages all dice's power is increased by 1 along with another effect if the Breakdown pages outnumber by 2 or more it will also increase damage and stagger damage by 1 on top of that. The passive of The Messenger is what makes the page have support capabilities as every scene he gains a random special combat page that can only be used on allies(these pages can give strengt, protection and stagger protection, page draw or restoring light) and at emotion level 3+ you are able to pick 1 out of 2 pages. Yan's unique pages are able to inflict a special status called erosion which causes the unit inflicted with it to take damage by the amount by the end of the scene reducing count by 1 along with dealing damage and stagger damage by that amount on hit. Yan also has a mass attack page called Distorted Blade which is a single slash 18-33 dice that inflicts 2 erosion.  </p>

        <h2>Xiao's Page</h2>
        <img src="https://libraryofruina.wiki.gg/images/XiaoIcon.png?35e548" alt="Xiao's Reception Logo"/>
        <p>Xiao's Page is obtained through the reception of Xiao. This key page is one of the best burn based pages along with a great offensive page. The passives of this page are Speed III, Fervor, Force of a Wildfire and Nine Children of the Dragons. Fervor is a simple buff as it gives the character with the page equipped +1 power to all dices. Force of a Wildfire makes it so whenever the character does melee damage they inflict 1 burn(burn does damage by the end of the scene by the amount) and the status of 'Force of a Wildfire' which makes it when the unit that had the status gets staggered they inflict burn to all of their allies based on half of how much burn they had and is rounded down. Nine Children of the Dragons is the most interesting passive she has as it makes it so at emotion level the character with the page equipped manifests E.G.O. which at first only increases the power of all dices by 1 and gives her access to multiple mass attacks and at emotion level 4+ makes it so at the start of every scene every enemy is inflicted with 2 burn. Xiao's page is almost as flexible as The Purple Tear's page but of course prioritizes the infliction of burn so it is advised to run multiple burn combat pages and burn related passives for this key page.</p>

        <h2> Black Silence Key Page</h2>
        <img src="https://libraryofruina.wiki.gg/images/BlackSilenceIcon.png?6b898d" alt="Black silence reception logo "/>
        <p>The Black Silence's Key Page is obtained at the end of the game during the fifth to last reception or the final reception of the Hana Association. The Key page can only be equipped on Roland on the first floor you ever unlock aka the Keter floor/floor of general works. This page is comparable to the Red Mist page in terms of how good it is. The passives of this page are Speed III, Orlando, and The Black silence. Orlando permantely makes sure Roland always has the page equipped no matter what along with his unique combat pages that cannot be swapped out. The Black Silence makes it so at the start of an act he draws two additional pages along with making it so the third page he uses will have all the dices on it gain +2 power. While the passives aren't much the real good part of this page comes from the unique combat pages. The unique pages are Ranga Workshop, Zelkova Workshop, Old Boys Workshop, Allas Workshop, Mook Workshop, Wheels Industry, Crystal Atelier, ATelier Logic, Durandal and lastly Furioso. The low cost pages are Zelkova Workshop, Old Boys Workshop, and Ranga Workshop which cost 0, 1 and 0 respicatively. Zelkova workshop has 2 dices that roll a 4-8 slash dice and a 3-8 blunt dice, the effects of this page are that on use Roland draws 1 page along with the passive effect of not allowing this page's cost to be changed. Old Boys Workshop restores 3 light on use and has 2 dices with a 5-9 Block dice and then a 4-8 blunt dice that on hit restores 5 stagger resist. Ranga Workshop shares the same effect as Zelkova workshp of not allowing the cost to be changed but instead the page has 3 dices all rolling a 3-7 with the first and second dice being pierce while the last one is a slash dice and inflicts 5 bleed(does damage based on bleed stack whenever a dice is rolled and then lessens the stack by a third when it triggers) next scene.  </p>
