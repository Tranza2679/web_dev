            <h2> If you're going to Utah then you might want to consider visting Bryce National Park!</h2>
            <h2>What is Bryce Canyon National Park?</h2>
            <p>Bryce Canyon National Park is in southern Utah and has a high altitude ranging from 8000 feet to over 9000 feet! However, despite it being named Bryce canyon it actually is not a canyon but a bunch of gigantic amphithears(which are spots that has a steep mountain or a specific rock formation amplifies or echoes sounds). The most notable feature of the environment are the many thin and tall spires of rock called hoodoos, and these were created through frost weathering along with erosion by steam from the river. The distinct colors of these hoodoos which are red, orange and white is what makes them even more recognizable! There are an even more beautiful part about the national park as its wildlife includes American Black Bears, American Badgers, Mule Deer, Utah Praire Dogs, a great variety of birds, Tiger Salamander, Glover's Silkmoth and Mormon Fritillary. Overall, Bryce Canyon National is a place with great looking land and as a wide variety of animals that will certainly make a trip there be memorable!</p>
