        <h1>Top 3 Lobotomy Corporation  Abnormalities</h1>
        <h2>What are Abnormalities?</h2>
        <p>Abnormalities in Lobotomy Corporation are monsters/beasts made from ideas out of people's heads, this can be from trauma, fears, fairytales and more. Each abnormality is given a classifcation based on how much energy they produce along with their danger they bring to the facility. The ranks from most safe to dangerous are ZAYIN, TETH, HE, WAW and ALEPH.</p>

            <dt>1: The Funeral of the Dead Butterflies</dt>
            <di><img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/lobotomycorp/images/5/5d/FuneraloftheDeadButterfliesCloseUp.png/revision/latest?cb=20171101191645" alt="Funeral of the Dead Butterflies" height ="100px"/></di>
            <di>Funeral of the Dead Butterflies is one of the best abnormalities because of how easy of an abnormality it is to manage, it is a HE level abnormality. It also is a justice trainer, which justice is a crucial stat for your agents to have leveled up later in the game as it makes them more better at suppressions. While this abnormality can breach and has a easy breaching method aka when someone finishes a bad work with it or have more than 3 fortitude, this abnormality is easy to deal with once you get even a bit of good E.G.O. gear. The E.G.O. gear is supplies is also amazing as it supplies a ranged weapon at a WAW level that deals both white(sanity) and black(both sanity and health) damage, though it's E.G.O. suit is alright for what it is having decent resistances but does look great along with the weapon.</di>
            <dt>2: Der Freischutz</dt>
            <di><img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/lobotomycorp/images/d/db/DerFreisch%C3%BCtzCloseUp.png/revision/latest?cb=20171117212352" alt="Der Freischutz" height="100px"/></di>
            <di>Der Freischutz is one of the best abnormalities because of how it is relatively decent to manage and can benefit the facility as a HE abnormality. It's gimmick is that it is able to be "requested" to shoot in a location at the cost of a small amount of energy you have gotten during the day, however due note while this bullet can hit abnormalities and do a considerable amount of black damage to them it can also harm employees alike and continues flying in the direction you shot at.It should also be noted that every 7th bullet is randomly placed, this effect also happens when their counter drops to zero during a bad work result or someone with low justice works with it. It's E.G.O. gear is some of the best early black damage and resistance you can obtain, it's E.G.O. weapon does considerable black damage at a distance at the cost of being able to hurt employees in the way and having a decently slow fire rate, and it's E.G.O. suit had really good resistances all around except for pale damage and when equipped buffs the min and max damage of it's corresponding weapon by two.</di>
            <dt>3: Knight of despair</dt>
            <di><img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/lobotomycorp/images/2/2f/TheKnightofDespairCloseUp.png/revision/latest?cb=20171105035606" alt="Knight of despair" height="100px"/></di>
            <di>Knight of Despair is one of the best abnormalities because of it being really easy for a WAW abnormality along with how it can benefit you. It's gimmick is that when an agent gets a good work result with it(only the first though) it will give the agent it's "blessing" which halves all the damage the agent will recieve except pale which it increases by 50%, do note that when an agent has a blessing they will be unable to work for the rest of the day with any abnormality. However, if this "blessed" agent ever dies then Knight of despair will breach and be a hard threat to deal with as she does long ranged pale damage along with a decently high health and only being weak to red damage. It has pretty nice E.G.O. gear with it's weapon being a fast attacking there be it short ranged white damage dealer and a suit that is resitant to every damage by 0.8.</di>
