        <h1>Strongest Key Pages in Library of Ruina</h1>
        <h2>What is Library of Ruina?</h2>
        <p>Library of Ruina is a card deckbuilder indie game. The main gameplay format involves either fighting guests by inviting them to the Library using books you obtain from guests before, or fighing Abnormalities which are monsters that can only be fought to level up floors of the library when you obtain certain books. Once you defeat a guest you obtain their book in which you have the option to burn the book to get combat pages(or cards that you use during fights) and possibly their key pages(which when equipped to one of your librarians give them access to their passives and resistances along with any unique combat pages they have). It should also be noted what floors are in this game, in the Library there are multiple floors with different Patron Libarians which are the first characters you are able to use when you first unlock the floor and you need to gain more librarians by leveling up said floor. The floors are the Floor of general works, History,Technological Sciences,Literature, Art, Natural Sciences, Language, Social Sciences, Philosophy and Religion. The Patron Libarians for these floors are respicatively  Roland, Malkuth, Yesod, Hod, Netzach, Tiphereth, Gebura, Chesed, Binah and Hokma which are names based off the Tree of Life except for Roland for reasons I shall not state for now. Now for more gameplay aspects I should explain is Light which is the resource that you make your libarians use to use combat pages, of course some require 0 and some 5 and since light is so important you should run at least 1 combat page that restores light, you can also getr light by emotion levels. Before I explain emotion levels I'm going to explain what aare dices, so dices are what are used when you use a combat pages and there are three types of dices which are combat dices which have subcatagories like blunt, slash or pierce combat dices which have no speical effects besides either doing more damage or stagger damage(Enemies and allies alike have a stagger bar) to enemies or less based on their resistances,  </p>
